# 🔧 Syntax Error Fixed

## ❌ **Problem:**
```
SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**
The issue was caused by improper string escaping in `agents/coordinator.py`. When copying code, the docstrings and f-strings had escaped quotes (`\"\"\"`) instead of proper quotes (`"""`).

## ✅ **Fixed:**

### **1. Docstrings**
```python
# Before (Error):
\"\"\"Generate AI-powered insights about the analysis results\"\"\"

# After (Fixed):
"""Generate AI-powered insights about the analysis results"""
```

### **2. F-strings**
```python
# Before (Error):
f\"\"\"Multi-line string with {variable}\"\"\"

# After (Fixed):
f"""Multi-line string with {variable}"""
```

### **3. String comparisons**
```python
# Before (Error):
if ai_response.startswith(\"LLM_ERROR:\"):

# After (Fixed):
if ai_response.startswith("LLM_ERROR:"):
```

## ✅ **Result:**
- ✅ All syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Python compilation successful
- ✅ AI insights feature now works correctly
